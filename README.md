# Snake game using teachable machine  

This is an application that has a snake and it has to reach its target by going through given directions.   
These directions are given using voice commands like up, down, left and right.  
The data collected are audio samples of saying left, right, up and down.  
Later we used Teachable machine interface for the collected data samples and trained the model.  
The model is then tested with random voice samples.
Finally the model is ready to be exported to the game.
